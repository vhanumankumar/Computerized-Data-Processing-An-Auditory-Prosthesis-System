The book focus on the design and development of Embedded Computing Bionic
Prosthesis using an FPGA based computerized Speech Processor for the patients
suffering from severe to profound hearing loss. It is one of the available bionic Implants
and is also known as Bionic ear or Auditory Prosthesis (AP) or Cochlear Implant System.
The proposed development is with greater emphasis on embedded hardware and software
development with efficient control algorithms. An Auditory Prosthesis system is a Real-
Time Embedded Computing System (RTECS) that is required to collect the real-time
speech/sound data, process the data by using speech/sound processing algorithm(s) and
send the processed speech data to the electrode array inserted in the damaged inner ear
(cochlea) for providing the speech recognition to the deafened person via inductive
transcutaneous RF-link. This process should run continuously without loss of
speech/sound information.
